This repository includes scripts required for the scRNAseq and RNAseq data analysis included in Thambyrajah et al. (2024).

The repository is organized in the following subfolders:

## Main_figures
Scripts required to reproduce main paper figures, specifically:
- Figure 2: scRNAseq data visualization
- Figure 3: scRNAseq data visualization
- Figure 6: RNAseq data visualization

In order to execute the code, source (processed) data must be downloaded from GEO repository:

- Accession ID GSE230792 for scRNAseq data. Download Cell annotation (cell metadata) and expression matrix (norm counts).
- Accession ID GSE230790 for RNAseq data.
